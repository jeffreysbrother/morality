##what is this about?

It has come to my attention that certain contemporary thinkers might be inadvertently changing the subject when discussing matters of morality. If the old philosophers were scrambling around in the wrong area, then it would be a substantial upgrade if we were to find---with the aid of science, perhaps---that previous discussions were lacking conceptually or empirically, somehow. It'd be a very different story, however, if these differences in findings were defended **as if** the topic hadn't changed.

##what I've heard recently

- that 'ought' can be derived from 'is' (contrary to Hume, a defender of nominalism and empiricism)
- that there are objectively better ways of acting (either as individuals or as communities)
- that science can account for the objective portion by appealing to human nature (evolutionary biology or evolutionary psychology, perhaps)

##a quick word about "objective" (which is, indeed, also a word)

What would it be for some action to be objectively more beneficial than another? What would it be for some action to be deemed a duty, independent of whatever decision or resulting consequence arises?

If 96% of a society regards action x as being disgusting and selfish, what would it mean for us to say that avoiding x is **objectively** more beneficial than indulging in x? If the individual is the focus, then the claim appears obviously false; some individuals enjoy rape and murder. If the community (or some other arbitrary group) is the focus, then the phrase "objectively better for society" appears to be nothing more than an emphatic way of expressing the fact that most people would have liked for x not to have happened.

"Objective", therefore, cannot mean "everyone agrees". There is simply no such agreement. Anywhere. Perhaps in this domain (ethics), the term is useless.

If this term serves as a method of emphasizing mere preferences (or perhaps cloaking them, with hopes that they appear more heavy-duty), we might still have another option on our hands. Not just preferences can be violated. Maybe we ought to be talking about health ... or perhaps the progress of civilization! We might have disagreements regarding individual or group *approval* but maybe science can help us get past all of this embarrassing, subjective talk and eventually graduate to facts and ... well, really neat objective things.

If we take this route, however, we'll need to start backpedalling very soon. Perhaps it was discovered that we have very good scientific (empirically and mathematically justified) reason to think that human (personal/economical/etc) and environmental well-being would increase drastically by eliminating the consumption of meat. Do we classify meat eaters as immoral NOW, or only after the theory is confirmed true? What happens if that rigorous model was flawed? Perhaps we stop eating meat and doing so ends up having a significant negative impact on ecosystems. Should we say, "Well, we thought x was objectively moral...but we discovered that it actually wasn't"? 

But what about non-consequentialist views of morality?

extra: and that our cogitations allow us to arrive at some line of action that is objectively better.

yes there are better ways of acting (ways that would either benefit ourselves or the most people)



differences
  nothing violated except perhaps reason (unless it never came to mind)
