#what is this about?

It has come to my attention that certain contemporary thinkers might be inadvertently changing the subject when discussing matters of morality. If the old philosophers were scrambling around in the wrong area, then it would be a substantial upgrade if we were to find---with the aid of science, perhaps---that previous discussions were lacking conceptually or empirically, somehow. It'd be a very different story, however, if these differences in findings were defended **as if** the topic hadn't changed.

#what I've heard recently

- that 'ought' can be derived from 'is' (contrary to Hume, a defender of nominalism and empiricism)
- that there are objectively better ways of acting (either as individuals or as communities)
- that science can account for the objective portion by appealing to human nature (evolutionary biology or evolutionary psychology, perhaps)

#a quick word about "objective" (which is, indeed, also a word)

What would it be for some line of action to be objectively better than another? What would it be for some action to be deemed a duty, independent of whatever decision or resulting consequence arises?



extra: and that our cogitations allow us to arrive at some line of action that is objectively better.

yes there are better ways of acting (ways that would either benefit ourselves or the most people)



differences
  nothing violated except perhaps reason (unless it never came to mind)
