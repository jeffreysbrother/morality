##what is this about?

It has come to my attention that certain contemporary thinkers might be inadvertently changing the subject when discussing matters of morality. If the old philosophers were scrambling around in the wrong area, then it would be a substantial benefit if we were to find---with the aid of science, perhaps---that previous discussions were lacking conceptually or empirically, somehow. It'd be a very different story, however, if these differences in findings were defended **as if** the topic hadn't changed.

##what I've heard recently

- that 'ought' can be derived from 'is' (contrary to Hume, a defender of nominalism and empiricism)
- that there are objectively superior ways of acting (either as individuals or as communities)
- that science can account for the objective portion by appealing to human nature or predictive models of any aspect of our existence (environment, happiness, etc)

##a quick word about "objective" (which is, indeed, also a word)

What would it be for some action to be objectively more beneficial than another? What would it be for some action to be deemed a duty, independent of whatever decision or resulting consequence arises?

If 96% of a society regards action x as being disgusting and selfish, what would it mean for us to say that avoiding x is **objectively** more beneficial than indulging in x? If the individual is the focus, then the claim appears obviously false; some individuals enjoy rape and murder. If the community (or some other arbitrary group) is the focus, then the phrase "objectively better for society" appears to be nothing more than an emphatic way of expressing the fact that most people would have liked for x not to have happened.

"Objective", therefore, cannot mean 'everyone agrees'. One reason is due to the fact that there is no such agreement regarding "ideal" or "responsible" or "authentic" action. Anywhere. Perhaps in this domain (ethics), the term is useless. I'll discuss an additional reason fairly soon.

If this term serves as a method of emphasizing mere preferences (or perhaps cloaking them, with hopes that they appear more heavy-duty), we might still have another option on our hands. Not only preferences can be violated. Maybe we ought to be talking about health ... or perhaps the progress of civilization! We might have disagreements regarding individual or group *approval* but maybe science can help us get past all of this embarrassing, subjective talk and eventually graduate to facts and ... well, really neat objective things.

If we take this route, however, we'll need to start backpedalling very soon. Imagine that we discover excellent scientific (empirically and mathematically justified) reason to think that human (personal/economical/etc) and environmental well-being would increase drastically by eliminating our consumption of meat. Do we classify meat eaters as immoral NOW, or only after the theory is confirmed true decades or centuries later? What happens if that rigorous model of ours proves to be flawed? Maybe we stop eating meat and this results in a significant negative impact on some corner of our ecosystem. Should we say, "Well, we *thought* x was objectively moral...but we discovered that it actually wasn't"? Must we stave off the urge to defend our moral inclinations until sufficient testing has taken place? What a boring place this would be, indeed! In the end every man should have some clever way to express his closeness to God and overarching superiority. LOL.

In addition to these silly issues with retroactive evaluations, it seems almost bonkers to look a 95-year-old lung cancer patient in the face and say "Delores, your poor condition evidences the fact that it *was* immoral for you to smoke."

##"objective"? (yes, again)

We usually use the word to delineate statements we consider to hold true independent of attitudes versus ones that **rely** upon attitudes at a basic level. This is why our previous efforts to cast preferences or even outcomes as "objective" fail miserably.

According to a common way of thinking (a pretty accurate way, I presume), a thing such as a chair has an objective existence. An experience of pain, however, is subjective in the sense that the sensation *depends* on us---the pain does not persist when we are destroyed. We should not fool ourselves into thinking that consensus has even the slightest ability to confer "objectivity" onto judgments related to the quality of actions. Even perfect consensus is insufficient grounds for claiming that an act can be rightly considered "immoral" in some objective sense.

##non-consequentialist views of morality

In my view, morality---if legitimate---must divorce itself from preference and utility. Why? Because these things are too easily parsed in terms that require no appeal to morality whatsoever; the concept is useless here. Additionally, aside from obvious reduction to non-ethical statements, preference and utility are inherently subjective. If the goal, ultimately, is to examine---objectively---utility and preference, any sensed progress (with respect to our desire to justify an objective morality; an *ought* from an *is*) is illusory. I do not deny that we might find that some society A prefers actions of type x and despises actions of type y. And since proponents of ethical study find thought experiments to be so interesting, I'll go a bit further. Even if we had the ability to make reliable predictions 400 years into the future (giving us the ability make better judgments about utility as it pertains to future societies and the environment), we'd still fall short of our goal because all this gives us is information such as "Society A prefers x" or "We've established, scientifically, that doing x will be good for Society A if A indents to y". Yes, if the former statement is true, it is true objectively because it's not merely someone's preference, but an accurate statement *about* preferences. But this is not what we're looking for! And yes, we might have excellent reason for thinking there could be an in-principle objective basis for the later but, since it is ultimately hypothetical (based on some condition obtaining), it cannot ground an objective morality.

EVEN IF we eliminate the hypothetical component from the statement above ... resulting in something like this: "We've established, scientifically, that doing x will be good for Society A" (imagining that maybe if we idealize our conversation a great deal by only talking about human *survival*, what we can say might be widely considered justified, accurate, or whatever), such a thing will---presumably---still be dependent upon contingent facts (our biology, environment, other circumstances, etc). In what sense are judgments of this nature objective if they depend upon us in more ways than one?

What's left? Divine command theory? Revelation? Fear of punishment in the afterlife? All of these theories are sufficiently embarrassing; they all fall short in terms of evidence, so we have no reason whatsoever to believe that any are accurate.

Moral realism (articulated any way you'd like) appears to be fueled by an attempt to circumvent the reality of fallibilism, the necessity of conceptual economy, and the importance of verification. Of course, we shouldn't deny the role apologetics can have in motivating uneducated activism and proselytization.

##an alternative

Instead of trying to mend a useless religious concept, all we need to say is that some individuals like x, while some do not. Of course, some feel-good things might turn out to be bad choices. This is life. Good things happen and horrible things happen.

If at this point you're squirming in your seat wondering how on earth we go about punishing people or implementing law, I'd like you to go look in the mirror and examine yourself for a couple minutes. Hopefully, after some time you'll realize that you've gone and changed the subject yet again.

Smoking too many cigarettes is a BAD IDEA. An unjust war and premeditated murder are horrific, fear-inducing events ... most people today would be inclined to classify only the latter two as "morally wrong". I fear that genuine motivations for this are slim: 1) religion or some other kind of dogma that impairs thinking (scientism, perhaps), 2) mostly harmless erroneous thought, and 3) the unfortunate fact that a human-independent fiction might be the only way to control a society.
